1. What is undefined behavior?
Undefined behavior means:
The C/C++ standard gives no guarantee about what happens

Examples
Accessing out-of-bounds array
Using uninitialized variable
Dereferencing NULL pointer
Accessing freed memory
Integer overflow (signed)

int a[5];
a[10] = 3;  // ❌ UB

➡️ Program may:
Crash
Produce wrong output
Work “sometimes” (dangerous!)

2. Dangling Pointer
A dangling pointer points to memory that has already been freed or gone out of scope.
int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
free(p);
// p is now dangling
*p = 10;  // ❌ undefined behavior

Causes
Access after free()
Returning address of local variable
Object deleted but pointer not reset

Fix
free(p);
p = NULL;

3. What Happens If You Access Freed Memory?

This is undefined behavior.
int *p = new int(10);
delete p;
*p = 20;   // ❌ UB
Possible outcomes
Crash (segmentation fault)
Corrupt heap
Silent bugs
Security vulnerability

Best Practice
delete p;
p = nullptr;
