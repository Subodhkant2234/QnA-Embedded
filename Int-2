1. What is undefined behavior?
Undefined behavior means:
The C/C++ standard gives no guarantee about what happens

Examples
Accessing out-of-bounds array
Using uninitialized variable
Dereferencing NULL pointer
Accessing freed memory
Integer overflow (signed)

int a[5];
a[10] = 3;  // ❌ UB

➡️ Program may:
Crash
Produce wrong output
Work “sometimes” (dangerous!)
